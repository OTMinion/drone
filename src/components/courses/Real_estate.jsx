        Real estate filming can take many forms, including smooth cinematic aerial shots outside
        showing an overview of a driveway, property, garden and perhaps pool, to fly-through drone
        tours showing each room, the features and layout as if you were a viewer. Using our
        specialist drones, we can fly from outside to inside (and back outside) your property. We
        can work with you as an estate agent or directly with you as a vendor.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We can also offer more dynamic shots, especially if there are particular landmarks or areas
        of interest close to your property. For example, if your property is close to the sea, we
        can use FPV drones to wind along pathways, coasts and cliffs before revealing your house.
        This can make your video more instantly engaging before we get to show the beauty of your
        home â€“ inside and out.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our real estate videos are often produced to music. These kind of specialised real estate
        tours are great at showing off a property from all angles, in the most concise yet engaging
        form available. They are great whether you are looking to sell, rent or promote your
        property for events.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In addition to the videos we produce, we can also take amazing photos (which we can either
        take separately or capture stills from the video footage). These can be provided with your
        video to add to your marketing campaign.
