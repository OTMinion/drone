          Traditional drone filming refers to getting many of the traditional drone shots that you
          see used on film and TV. These kind of shots are generally slow (and sometimes static),
          smooth, and are used to give an elevated perspective of a scene that is generally
          impossible or very difficult to achieve using traditional ground-based videography. At its
          simplest, it offers a different perspective to other camera angles, but then allows for
          much more creative scope by offering all the kinds of shots used at ground level – in the
          air – but then adds a lot of other creative options on top including movement.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Examples of shots include:</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
          <li>Static, raised perspective shots (e.g. tripod in the air shots)</li>
          <li>Panning and following (from behind, in front, and sideways to a subject)</li>
          <li>Reveal shots (with the drone flying upwards)</li>
          <li>Tracking shots (e.g. moving with a car)</li>
          <li>
            Point of view shots (where the subject to be filmed remains at the centre of the shot)
          </li>
          <li>
            Hyperlapses (condensed time-based shots where the footage appears sped up to show time
            passing)
          </li>
          <li>Night-time shots</li>
          <li>Other special shots (like orbiting etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Traditional drone shots can look amazing. They can be combined with clever editing to
          further enhance their appeal (for example, using speed ramps to speed up and emphasise
          certain aspects of the footage).

          Combining excellent piloting skills, a cinematic eye for getting great footage and
          perspectives, and knowledge of filming in a wide variety of settings helps us get the best
          possible footage for your project.

          We use a couple of different options for traditional drone filming from ‘mini’ drones that
          allow us to film almost anywhere to larger drones that provide many more features. It is a
          staple of the filming we do here at Cinematic FPV.
